A compilation of wrappers around the webutils in TouchDesigner.

##WebClient
A wrapper around the webClientDAT, allowing for an async workflow with an API similiar to requests or axios.

##WebServer
A routed wrapper around the WebServerDAT, allowing for routed handlers and middleware. Truly amazing (not measured by regular webstandarts.)

##Downloader
Async dowload of file via HTTP protocoll. Because, why not?
